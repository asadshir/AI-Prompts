I’m looking for a free, open-source AI model that can be run on a regular PC without requiring expensive or high-end hardware, focused specifically on programming tasks. The goal is to use it for code generation and debugging in Pine Script v6 (TradingView). It doesn’t need to work offline — internet access is available. Ideally, the model should be trainable or customizable using online documentation (e.g., Pine Script v6 official docs), so it can learn from and specialize in this narrow domain. Please recommend the most suitable models, tools, or frameworks for this use case, with an emphasis on simplicity, focus, and low resource usage. Please provide your response in Persian (Farsi).
